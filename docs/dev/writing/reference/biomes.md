# Writing for Biomes

All biomes are different from each other and this should be taken into account when writing (e.g a generalized hunting patrol shouldn't mention fishing in the desert). If the content you're writing is generalized (available in any biome), then you have to be careful to make it _truly_ general in nature, able to be triggered no matter _what_ the circumstances. Therefore, under most circumstances, making biome (or even camp) specific content is preferred for a more detailed, rich gameplay experience. 

Each biome also has different prey available - see the randomized prey lists for inspiration, but be creative (though realistic) with your own prey choices. Cats cannot take down a giraffe, but there's plenty of unique things in the right size range for them to hunt that you _could_ include in your content. 

**Here's a brief overview of our currently planned biomes, and their differences:**

- **Seasonality** refers to how strongly the seasons affect the biome. 
- **Hazardous** refers to the overall amount of danger (both in terms of environment and hostile creatures) the biome contains. 
- **Herb availability** refers to how easy it is to gather herbs. 
- **Difficulty of interactions** with cats outside the Clan refers to both how frequent and how dangerous interactions with rogues and loners are. 
- **Amount of Twolegs interactions** refers to how often Twolegs are seen in that biome and affect the Clan cats. 

## Beach

- Beach is a **low** seasonality environment. 
- Beach is a **medium** hazardous environment. 
- Beach has **medium** herb availability.
- Beach has a **medium** difficulty of interactions with cats outside the Clan.
- Beach has a **high** amount of Twolegs interactions.

!!! tip
    Take into account how seasons will affect the danger of being in the water e.g cold water in leaf-fall vs freezing water in leaf-bare. The Clans here will have increased skill checks for the swimmer skill, and interact with the water far more than land based biomes. 

## Desert

- Desert is a **high** seasonality environment.
- Desert is a **high** hazardous environment.
- Desert has **low** herb availability.
- Desert has an **easy** difficulty of interactions with cats outside the Clan.
- Desert has a **low** amount of Twolegs interactions.

!!! tip
    Take into account how the highly seasonal desert will affect the difficulty of the patrol. Greenleaf is dangerous in the desert - more sunlight is worse for the Clan. This results in the most interesting feature of the desert compared to other biomes - **desert has flipped seasons**. Leaf-bare, the rainy season, is a time of plenty, while greenleaf, the dry season, is a time of scarcity. Fresh water is an important resource here in ways not experienced in other biomes.

    Cats outside the Clans and Twolegs are both rare in the desert, as it's not the most hospitable environment. While snow and sleet do fall in the desert on rare occasions, mostly leaf-bare has rain, not snow. 

## Forest

- Forest is a **medium** seasonality environment.
- Forest is a **medium** hazardous environment.
- Forest has **medium** herb availability.
- Forest has a **medium** difficulty of interactions with cats outside the Clan.
- Forest has a **medium** amount of Twolegs interactions.

!!! tip
    Forest is the 'default' biome, intended to most closely mimic the experience and risks of the warrior cats canon environment. This means that content created for the forest biome should more closely mimic the content in the warriors cat books than other biomes. You should make increased numbers of skill checks for the climber skill in this biome.

## Mountainous

- Mountainous is a **high** seasonality environment.
- Mountainous is a **high** hazardous environment.
- Mountainous has **high** herb availability.
- Mountainous has an **easy** difficulty of interactions with cats outside the Clan.
- Mountainous has a **low** amount of Twolegs interactions.

!!! tip
    Living in the mountains isn't easy, but it affords the Clans who can survive there safety and isolation that are more difficult to come by then in other biomes. Snow falls in leaf-fall and newleaf, not just in leaf-bare, and leaf-bare has a deeper and colder chill than is display in warrior cats canon. 

## Plains

- Plains are a **medium** seasonality environment.
- Plains are a **medium** hazardous environment.
- Plains have **medium** herb availability. 
- Plains have a **medium** difficulty of interactions with cats outside the Clan.
- Plains has a **medium** amount of Twolegs interactions.

!!! tip
    While sharing the same difficulty setting as forest, plains has a unique vibe with wide open spaces, a lack of cover, and a great dependence on the seasonal cycle of grass growth. You should create increased numbers of runner skill checks for this biome. These Clans frequently use tunnels to their advantage.

## Wetlands

- Wetlands are a **low** seasonality environment.
- Wetlands are a **high** hazardous environment.
- Wetlands have **high** herb availability.
- Wetlands have a **medium** difficulty of interactions with cats outside the Clan.
- Wetlands has a **medium** amount of Twolegs interactions.

!!! tip
    Take into account how seasons will affect the danger of being in the water e.g cold water in leaf-fall vs freezing water in leaf-bare. The wetlands has snow and sleet fall, and frosts, but, similar to beach, snow is unlikely to build up thickly on the ground (the real problem is MUD). While wetlands environments have high herb availability, this is also the environment where is it the most easy to get poisoned or envenomed (chomped by a venomous creature). Wetlands Clans also eat a truly diverse array of frogs, snakes, and fish that makes the canonical ShadowClan diet look very normal and sensible. Expected increased numbers of swimmer skill checks in such a damp biome.
